This program was an excersize to practice the application of timers and ioctl
calls. The driver makes a led blink SOS in morse code. The final output is
captured in a pdf, ledLogicAnalyzeOutput.pdf. The pdf printout is from using
the intronix logic analyzer. the first edge of the sos signal is cut off 
slightly because the captured output was pattern triggered instead of edge
 triggered. 

This code is mostly the combination of the led driver found from sysprogs.com
and a driver from 'writing linux device drivers: a guide with excercises,' by
Jerry Cooperstein. 

after loading the device via insmod, the device automatically registers. 
however, the permissions of the device are crw------ and so ioctl calls 
won't work. It's necessary to change the permissions of the registered devnode
via sudo chmod 666 /dev/mycdrv before running the test usermode application
to send the ioctl.
